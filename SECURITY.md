### Security Policy
We at PkgForge take [security very seriously](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/soarpkgs/security).<br>
If you have found a valid vulnerability in our code, workflows or the SBUILDs, please report it at your earliest convenience.

### Reporting a Vulnerability
Please use one of the following channels to report it to us:
- [Create an Issue](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs/issues/new) (Use this option only if public reporting will NOT compromise our current security posture)
- [Contact Us](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/contact/chat) (Select this method if public disclosure could negatively impact our security posture)
- [Reach out to the Team Members](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/readme/people) (Opt for this if you require the most private and confidential communication channel)

### Expectations
- We assess vulnerabilities using the [CVSS framework](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0).
- High/critical vulnerabilities are addressed within 24 hours of being reported

> [!WARNING]
As a FOSS project that is entirely self-funded, we are unable to offer monetary rewards or bounties.<br>
However, we will credit your contribution in any code fixes or patches arising from your report.
